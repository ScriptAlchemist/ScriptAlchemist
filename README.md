Hey, I'm Justin ðŸ‘‹ 

As a former professional skydiver with over 5,000 jumps under my belt, I have developed a keen understanding of the importance of precision, teamwork, and adaptability. These qualities have translated well into my experience working in technology, where I have excelled in various roles such as software development, 3D printing, CAD modeling, and even community-heavy projects like Cardano Goat, an NFT community where I built tools to interact with Cardano wallets.

My expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, Golang, and Rust, coupled with my experience in systems design, software development, automation. I've been honing my ability to build reusable and self-documenting code. I pride myself on following strict coding design principles, ensuring that the technology I create is efficient and sustainable.
